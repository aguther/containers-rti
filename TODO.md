# TO DO

## General Improvements

* copy kubectl config to all nodes
* copy kubectl config to local host if requested (add context)

## Multiple Execution Issues

* docker/registry: add hostname to certificates to support multiple registries
* keepalived: sometimes it seems that network configuration gets corrupted
  -> check health check script again
